# Contact Management System

This is a simple Python-based contact management system that allows you to add, modify, delete, and view contacts. The contacts are stored in a list, and each contact has a first name and a last name.

# Features

**View Contacts:** 
Displays a formatted list of all the contacts with their index numbers.

**Add a Contact:** 
Allows the user to add a new contact by providing a first and last name.

**Modify a Contact:** 
Allows the user to modify an existing contact by specifying its index.

**Delete a Contact:** 
Allows the user to delete a contact by specifying its index.

# How It Works

The program uses a list to store the contacts, where each contact is a list containing the first name and last name. The contacts are indexed starting from 0, and the user can manage the list of contacts using several functions.
